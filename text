Dear Sir,

I want to draw your attention towards the following facts -
 Whatever was informed to us at the time of taking membership is different from what the customer care person speaks.
Your representative promised for Diamond Card (4 adults) Membership but now the caller from customer care says Gold Membership
We were informed of a package with 45 days
A shopping voucher worth INR 10,000
The AMC for Diamond card was said to be INR 8500 despite being mentioned INR 14000 in agreement
Pick, Drop and Sight-seeing(25 kms range) facility should also be included in the 70,000 amount only as per the talk with the representative
Movie Tickets for 4 adults were promised
Regarding the EMI, we were said the processing fees will be given by the company itself and convert the 70,000 amount in 72 EMIs. Despite of amount being deducted from my card the EMI hasn't started yet and there is no information regarding the same
We were also said that though the company doesn't book trip tickets but we will be given 40-50% discounts on the travel tickets
Total Cost mentioned was 70,000 including the Administration charges but now your customer care person says something different.
Overall our concern is that Maximum of the points said by the representative in person and on customer care call are contradicting. How can a customer rely on a company where 2 employees are contradicting their own points. This is an unethical behaviour and hence I want to cancel my Membership.
